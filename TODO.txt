TODO

 - Think about how ARQ could initialise LARQ checking in the classpath.
   (LARQ depends on ARQ, therefore ARQ should not depend on LARQ to avoid
   a cycle in our dependencies).

 - Publish artifacts to the http://www.openjena.org/repo-dev/ and /repo/
   repositories, can we use maven-release-plugin there?

 - Check if https://github.com/castagna/LARQ is still necessary, if not
   remove it and/or point at SVN on SourceForge.

 - Add an assembly.xml to distribute LARQ, or we should avoid this and
   just publish the jar and distribute it with ARQ.
